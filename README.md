# go-tetris-go
Remake of Tetris, [a 3D game university project done in C++ with 3 friends of mine](https://github.com/AndreJesusBrito/OpenGL-Tetris), in Rust & OpenGL (just for fun)

> TODO: Insert cool ingame pic here

## Motivation
I have 3 reasons for doing this project:
- First of all, just for fun. It has been a long time since I have done some of these projects I do just for fun, so why not. I guess is good to be back, yeah!
- Second, I was so proud of the game we did (I know, its very simple and definitely not a AAA game, but its very cool anyways...) that I wanted to have a more refined and accessible version of it, a *web* version perhaps. I have a old JS version from some years ago but I decided to give another lang a try, which leads me to the third point...
- This looks like a first cool project to learn Rust. It's the cool language of the moment, so also why not. Let's see what _Borrowing_, _Traits_ and _Lifetimes_ can do (and also _Macros_ for GLSL, hype).

## Try it yourself
In the future I will have a running page with the game ported to WebAssembly (WASM) so that everyone can play the game in the browser. I can also put it my (future... maybe) portfolio just for flex ;)

If you want to test it locally on your machine see the Build instructions below.

## Build
WIP...

## Contributions
This project is a very personal one, so I want to do it in my own. Maybe in the future I can make it more open for collaboration, but for now it's a path I have to travel on my own...

Not really... I'm new to Rust so I will probably make mistakes. If you have tips feel free to share in the issues tab. But yeah, no PRs for now.
